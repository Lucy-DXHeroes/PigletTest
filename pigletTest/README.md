# Piglet

This repository is a sanctuary for all the selenium tests expertly named as **the Piglets**.<br/>
This readme is for Java programmers and also Windows users at the same time.<br/>
It sucks, I know... 

_What are **the Piglets**?_<br/>
	Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications.<br/>
	Basically **the Piglets** simulate user behavior, click through the application<br/>
  and most of all have high expectations of the results.<br/>
	*The Piglets* do not compromise. That's my job to guide them on the right path.<br/>

_But why do you call them **"the Piglets"**?_<br/>
	The shortcut for selenium is sele. Sele is also a Czech word for a piglet.<br/>
	Since I worked for the whole year as a tester in a QA team consisting of me, myself and I,<br/>
  we made a democratic decision to start using this name.<br/>
	We like this designation. Sometimes you can also hear us call them **piggies**.<br/>

_How can I run **"the Piglets"**?_<br/>
	You can run them if you have the Runnable JAR file (testStfuAndClick.jar) that should be located here:<br/>
  **TestProject/lib/runnableJarFile**<br/>
	Next thing you need is a chromedriver.exe. You can find it here:<br/>
  **TestProject/drivers/**<br/>
  These two components has to be together in a file called Drivers.<br/>
  Once it's ready, open cmd and write:<br/>
  ```
  java -jar <path>\filename.jar
  ```

**!! Warning !!**<br/>

  All those who misuse these tests for a purpose other than what they were destined to be,<br/>
	will be cursed and hunted down by the Great Holy Piglet.<br/>
	
  You don't want to upset the Great Holy Piglet.<br/>

  All glory to the Great Holy Piglet!
